Welcome!

I am currently a Quantitative Researcher at <a href="https://www.jumptrading.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jump Trading</a>.

Previously, I was a Research Scientist at <a href="https://research.facebook.com/teams/cas/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Central Applied Science</a>, <a href="https://research.facebook.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Meta Research</a>, working on scientific innovations to drive product impact across the company. Before that, I was a Quantitative Researcher at <a href="https://www.citadelsecurities.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Citadel Securities</a>.

I received my Ph.D. in statistics in 2021 from the <a href="https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a> at Harvard University, where I was advised by Professor <a href="http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lucas Janson</a> and Professor <a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~junliu/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jun Liu</a>. My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, nonparametric statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo. During my PhD, I created and taught the course <em>Introduction to Probability and Statistical Inference</em> at <a href="https://summer.harvard.edu/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Harvard Summer School</a> in 2018.

Prior to Harvard, I earned a B.S. in statistics from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young#University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Special Class for the Gifted Young</a>, <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China</a> (Chinese: <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B0%91%E5%B9%B4%E7%8F%AD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">中科大少年班</a>) in 2016.
